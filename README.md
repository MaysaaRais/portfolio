# Quantitative Finance & AI Portfolio â€” Maysaa Rais

This repository contains a curated collection of technical projects at the intersection of financial modeling, quantitative research, and applied AI.  
Each notebook is built from scratch and focuses on clean, reproducible code using real market data. No pre-built pricing or ML libraries are used â€” every model is manually implemented to ensure full control and understanding of the underlying mathematics.

## Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Black-Scholes Pricing Engine](./BlackScholes/README.md) | Option pricing using the analytical Black-Scholes formula, with full derivation of Greeks and 3D visualizations |
| Heston Monte Carlo Framework](./HestonModel/README.md) | Monte Carlo pricing with stochastic volatility and parameter calibration using real market data |
| Exotic Option Greeks | Monte Carlo estimation of Greeks for exotic options (Asian, Barrier) |
| Volatility Forecasting | Volatility forecasting using GARCH(1,1) vs a custom RNN implemented from scratch |
| Anomaly Detection in Market Microstructure | Anomaly detection in trading behavior using unsupervised models on transaction data |
